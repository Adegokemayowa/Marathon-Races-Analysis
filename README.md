# Marathon Races Analysis 🏃‍♂️📊

This is my first data analysis project done entirely in **Python**.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I explored and analyzed marathon race data to uncover insights related to race times, participant demographics, and performance trends. The entire analysis was conducted in a **Jupyter Notebook** using Python libraries such as **Pandas** and **Seaborn**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis  
- **Seaborn** for data visualization

## 📈 Key Highlights

- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis
- Explored relationships between age, gender, and marathon completion times
- Visualized trends and patterns using various chart types (histograms, scatter plots,violin plot, etc.)
- Drew insights that could inform training strategies and event planning
